# Analysis Strategies for Marine Icing and Impact Module Images

Image analysis strategy has been developed to analyze Marine Icing images for the purpose of obtaining quantitative time series icing thickness growth. The same technique has been also found to be very effective for acquiring pressure data from images from a novel opto-mechanical pressure sensor technology that is incorporated in a new ice impact panel. The images from the Impact Module provide the test information of dropping an ice block onto the Module, and the analysis technique is able to analyze the images because the test information is recorded on the width of the object and can be calculated from the measurements. 


## Image Analysis for Marine Icing

Ice accumulation on a vessel is usually caused by fog, freezing rain, and sea spray accumulating on the superstructure or the hull and freezing under their freezing points. In order to enhance the icing strength of a boat, researchers need to find the maximum icing impact and to provide necessary emergency warning. The requirement of researching ice impact is to collect detailed data from ice accumulation. In order to collect the data of vessel icing, the Marine Icing Monitoring System (MIMS) is designed for monitoring the event on the boat.
