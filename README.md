SUMMARY
Image analysis strategies have been developed and shown to be useful for
analyzing images from marine icing events to obtain quantitative time series icing
thickness measurements. The same techniques were also found to be very effective
for acquiring pressure data from images from a novel opto-mechanical pressure
sensor technology that is incorporated in a new ice impact panel.
